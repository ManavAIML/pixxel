‚Ä¢	Dynamic Front-End Experience:
o	Precisely Replicated Loader Page: The application greets users with a meticulously recreated loader page, accurately reflecting the provided snapshot's overall design, layout, visual elements, animations, color schemes, typography, and positioning of elements.
o	Interactive Image Grid with Cursor Animations: Features an image grid with specific cursor animations that transform and trigger subtle visual effects or animations on the images themselves (e.g., a ripple, highlight, or zoom effect) as the cursor interacts with them.
o	Animated Hamburger Navigation Bar: An accurately replicated animated hamburger navigation bar ensures a fluid user experience, showcasing detailed animations for its initial state, opening (icon transformation, menu appearance), fully opened state (layout, background, links), and closing animations.
o	Seamless Infinite Marquee: Implements a continuously scrolling strip of content that perfectly mimics the visual flow, speed, and seamless looping of an infinite marquee effect as demonstrated in the reference.
o	Responsive Ripple Effect: Incorporates a dynamic ripple effect that emanates outwards from a point of interaction (like a click or tap), resembling the ripples created when an object is dropped into water, providing satisfying and intuitive visual feedback.
